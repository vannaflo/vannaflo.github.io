# Vanna Cervania's Portfolio

Hello! My name is Vanna Cervania and I am a computer science major at CSUF, planning on graduating in 2027 and hoping to go into development.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 will always be my favorite because it feels like an initiation into the computer science world. It's crucial to learn the basics of git, and though the lab doesn't do much, it involves the foundation of all other codes we've done in other labs, such as #include, std::cout, return, int, and main. 

* Lab 4, Part 2

    I would consider Lab 4: part 2, as a favorite because I found it slightly diffucult when I first tried to do it, and I also found it enjoyable to to play around with when running it. I used to find it difficult because of having to figure out the if statements, initializing variables and figuring out where to put them, but looking back on it now, I see it as a code that I could write easily. 

* Lab 9, Part 2

    Another favorite lab was Lab 9: part 2. I fell beind in labs, but coming back to Lab 9, I was able to figure out a good amount of the code without needing help. I found it fairly easy, but only struggled with using the secret.dat file in game.cc and secret.cc. It was new to use ifstream and ofstream, but I was able to get help and figure out what my mistakes were. Lab 9 was a good stepping stone into the more confusing codes that I may struggle with.
